*.mplstyle files in this directory augment system-wide Matplotlib config
on your system located in site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc
(relative to your Python installation location).

Matplotlib styles used by DNS Shotgun plotters are defined as comma delimited
list of styles in SHOTGUN_MPLSTYLES environment variable. It defaults to
"shotgun" and thus by default loads file "shotgun.mplstyle" from this directory.

Items listed later in the list can redefine values from preceding files, i.e.
SHOTGUN_MPLSTYLES="shotgun,presentation,fast,grayscale"
starts with "shotgun" style as base and the "presentation" style redefines
individual settings.

Matplotlib provides its own styles, e.g. "fast", "tableau-colorblind10" etc.
See site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/stylelib.

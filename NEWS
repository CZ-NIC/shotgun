DNS Shotgun v20210203
=====================

- new user interface
  - replay.py is now the main tool instead of shotgun.lua
  - new configuration format to support complex scenarios
  - mixed-protocol traffic replay is supported
  - some scripts in `tools/` were renamed
- fast scripts for processing PCAP data
  - can be found in `pcap/`
  - these replaced the now removed pellet.py and scale.py
- added IPv4 support
- DoH is now fully supported
- comprehensive usage documentation is available at https://dns-shotgun.readthedocs.io
- minimum required dnsjit version is 1.1.0


DNS Shotgun v20200914
=====================

- fully supported UDP, TCP and DNS-over-TLS with
  [dnsjit](https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dnsjit) 1.0.0
- fully supported DNS-over-HTTPS with development version of dnsjit
- traffic can be replayed only over IPv6
- user interface
  - may be unstable
  - only very basic UI available
  - more complex scenarios are no supported yet
    (e.g. simultaneously using multiple protocols)
- pellet.py is functional, but it is very slow and requires python-dpkt from
  master
